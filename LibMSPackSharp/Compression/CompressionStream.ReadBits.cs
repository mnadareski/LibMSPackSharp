    /* This header defines macros that read data streams by
    * the individual bits
    *
    * INIT_BITS         initialises bitstream state in state structure
    * STORE_BITS        stores bitstream state in state structure
    * RESTORE_BITS      restores bitstream state from state structure
    * ENSURE_BITS(n)    ensure there are at least N bits in the bit buffer
    * READ_BITS(var,n)  takes N bits from the buffer and puts them in var
    * PEEK_BITS(n)      extracts without removing N bits from the bit buffer
    * REMOVE_BITS(n)    removes N bits from the bit buffer
    *
    * READ_BITS simply calls ENSURE_BITS, PEEK_BITS and REMOVE_BITS,
    * which means it's limited to reading the number of bits you can
    * ensure at any one time. It also fails if asked to read zero bits.
    * If you need to read zero bits, or more bits than can be ensured in
    * one go, use READ_MANY_BITS instead.
    *
    * These macros have variable names baked into them, so to use them
    * you have to define some macros:
    * - BITS_TYPE: the type name of your state structure
    * - BITS_VAR: the variable that points to your state structure
    * - define BITS_ORDER_MSB if bits are read from the MSB, or
    *   define BITS_ORDER_LSB if bits are read from the LSB
    * - READ_BYTES: some code that reads more data into the bit buffer,
    *   it should use READ_IF_NEEDED (calls read_input if the byte buffer
    *   is empty), then INJECT_BITS(data,n) to put data from the byte
    *   buffer into the bit buffer.
    *
    * You also need to define some variables and structure members:
    * - byte[] i_ptr;    // current position in the byte buffer
    * - byte[] i_end;    // end of the byte buffer
    * - uint bit_buffer; // the bit buffer itself
    * - uint bits_left;  // number of bits remaining
    *
    * If you use read_input() and READ_IF_NEEDED, they also expect these
    * structure members:
    * - struct mspack_system *sys;  // to access sys->read()
    * - uint error;         // to record/return read errors
    * - byte input_end;    // to mark reaching the EOF
    * - byte[] inbuf;       // the input byte buffer
    * - uint inbuf_size;    // the size of the input byte buffer
    *
    * Your READ_BYTES implementation should read data from *i_ptr and
    * put them in the bit buffer. READ_IF_NEEDED will call read_input()
    * if i_ptr reaches i_end, and will fill up inbuf and set i_ptr to
    * the start of inbuf and i_end to the end of inbuf.
    *
    * If you're reading in MSB order, the routines work by using the area
    * beyond the MSB and the LSB of the bit buffer as a free source of
    * zeroes when shifting. This avoids having to mask any bits. So we
    * have to know the bit width of the bit buffer variable. We use
    * <limits.h> and CHAR_BIT to find the size of the bit buffer in bits.
    *
    * If you are reading in LSB order, bits need to be masked. Normally
    * this is done by computing the mask: N bits are masked by the value
    * (1<<N)-1). However, you can define BITS_LSB_TABLE to use a lookup
    * table instead of computing this. This adds two new macros,
    * PEEK_BITS_T and READ_BITS_T which work the same way as PEEK_BITS
    * and READ_BITS, except they use this lookup table. This is useful if
    * you need to look up a number of bits that are only known at
    * runtime, so the bit mask can't be turned into a constant by the
    * compiler.
    * The bit buffer datatype should be at least 32 bits wide: it must be
    * possible to ENSURE_BITS(17), so it must be possible to add 16 new bits
    * to the bit buffer when the bit buffer already has 1 to 15 bits left.
