    /// uses it to send literal messages to the library user.

    /// When the library is compiled normally, passing null to a compressor or
    /// decompressor constructor will result in a default SystemImpl being

    /// SystemImpl structure, with the library user's own methods. This
    /// allows for more abstract interaction, such as reading and writing files
    /// directly to memory, or from a network socket or pipe.

    /// documentation entries for every structure member, and write methods
